# Gmail-clone
I created a Gmail clone that provides basic email functionalities, such as inbox, sent mail, drafts, and a trash folder. I hosted this project on Firebase, which offers a robust backend platform. Firebase was used for authentication, real-time database, and cloud storage. With the authentication service, users can log into their accounts or create new ones.

Emails are stored in the real-time database, ensuring that users' inboxes and other folders are updated instantly. Firebase's real-time sync feature ensures smooth and seamless communication between the frontend and backend. For file attachments, Firebase Cloud Storage was integrated, allowing users to upload and download attachments securely.

Hosting the application on Firebase made deployment simple and provided scalability, ensuring the app can handle multiple users efficiently. Overall, Firebase's combination of services made it an ideal platform to build and host the Gmail clone.
